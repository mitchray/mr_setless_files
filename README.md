# Fileset for Setless Files (concrete5 5.7)
Installing this package will create a new "Setless" fileset, and automatically add/remove files as needed.

## Setting Up
You only have to add your existing "Files In No Sets" to the new "Setless" fileset once, from then on new files will automatically be added to "Setless", and removed from "Setless" if added to other sets. Do this in batches if you have a ton of files.

In the File Manager, filter the files by *In Set(s)* "Files In No Sets" and select them. Add them to the "Setless" fileset via the ***With Selected* dropdown.

##Next Steps
Now you can control "Setless" files with Advanced Permissions!

## 5.6 Version
